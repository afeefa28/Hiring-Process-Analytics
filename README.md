Company Hiring Process Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project analyzes the hiring process of a multinational company to extract meaningful insights from its hiring data. The hiring process is crucial for companies to ensure a balanced and well-suited workforce. This analysis focuses on trends such as gender distribution, salary analysis, departmental distribution, and position tiers. Using Excel, we clean and prepare the data, handle missing values, detect and address outliers, and summarize the insights through visualizations and statistics.

Objectives:
Analyze the gender distribution in the company's hiring process.
Examine salary structures and distributions, including calculating the average salary and creating salary class intervals.
Visualize the distribution of employees across departments.
Analyze the distribution of positions across different levels or tiers within the company.
Data Analytics Tasks:
A. Hiring Analysis: Gender Distribution
Goal: To determine the number of male and female hires.
Approach: Calculate the total number of male and female hires using Excel functions like COUNTIF.
B. Salary Analysis: Average Salary
Goal: To calculate the average salary offered by the company.
Approach: Use Excel's AVERAGE function to calculate the mean salary for all employees.
C. Salary Distribution: Class Intervals
Goal: To understand salary distribution by dividing the salaries into class intervals.
Approach: Define appropriate class intervals (e.g., $0–$10,000, $10,001–$20,000, etc.) and calculate how many salaries fall within each range using FREQUENCY or COUNTIFS.
D. Departmental Analysis
Goal: To visualize the proportion of employees across various departments.
Approach: Create a pie chart or bar graph using a Pivot Table in Excel to show the distribution across departments.
E. Position Tier Analysis
Goal: To represent the distribution of employees across different position tiers (e.g., Entry-Level, Mid-Level, Senior-Level).
Approach: Group positions into tiers and create a stacked bar chart or similar visualization to highlight how many employees are in each tier.
